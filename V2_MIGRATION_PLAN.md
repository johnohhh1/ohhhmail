# ChiliHead OpsManager v2 Migration Plan
## Project Management & Systems Architecture View

---

## 🔄 UPDATED: Current State & Revised Plan (2025-11-25)

### What We Actually Have Now
Based on real system assessment (see [CURRENT_STATE_ASSESSMENT.md](./CURRENT_STATE_ASSESSMENT.md)):

**✅ Working Services:**
- AUBS backend (port 5000) with SimpleOrchestrator + EmailAnalyzer + Chat
- SnappyMail (port 8888) configured with Gmail IMAP ✅ **Done Right**
- Open-WebUI running (port 3000) ⚠️ **Has tabs but wired poorly**
- PostgreSQL, Redis, NATS, Ollama (all healthy)

**✅ Completed Cleanup:**
- Removed Dolphin orchestration code ✅
- Removed UITARS monitoring code ✅
- Deleted Docker containers for Dolphin/UITARS/old frontend ✅
- Updated docker-compose.yml ✅

**❌ Not Started Yet:**
- Email tools (get_emails, triage_email, etc.) - Phase 0 focus
- Task tools (CRUD operations) - Phase 1
- Calendar integration - Phase 2
- Vision/OCR - Phase 3
- RAG/Memory - Phase 4

### Key Corrections Applied

1. **Direct IMAP Approach** ✅
   - NO EmailCache table (v1 concept removed)
   - NO sync job needed
   - Direct imaplib connection to Gmail
   - Same source SnappyMail uses

2. **NO Sharing with v1** ✅
   - Fresh v2 database (when needed)
   - Clean separation from v1
   - v1 continues running independently (ports 3001, 8002)

3. **SnappyMail Usage** ✅
   - For viewing only (full HTML rendering)
   - Screenshot + Vision AI for OCR (Phase 3)
   - Independent of AUBS data flow

### Realistic Timeline from Current State

**Phase 0 (2 days):** First tool working
- ✅ Day 1: Clean Docker (DONE), Fix AUBS /ready endpoint
- 🔄 Day 2: Implement get_emails() tool, test with Open-WebUI

**Phase 1 (1 week):** Email + Task tools
**Phase 2 (1 week):** Calendar + Delegations
**Phase 3 (3 days):** Vision + Screenshots
**Phase 4 (3 days):** Memory + RAG

**Total:** 3-4 weeks (not 6-8 weeks as originally planned)

---

## Executive Summary

**What We're Doing**: Migrating from a traditional multi-tab web app (v1) to an AI-native conversational platform (v2) built on Open-WebUI.

**Why**: v1 has fundamental architectural problems that can't be fixed with patches:
- **Chat fragmentation** - Every tab has its own chat = no shared context
- **Context loss** - AI can't remember what "that invoice" means across pages
- **Click-heavy UX** - Too much navigation, not enough conversation
- **Email sanitization** - Gmail API loses images/formatting
- **Memory fragmentation** - Agent memory system exists but isn't unified

**The Vision**: One conversational interface (AUBS) with full context across emails, tasks, calendar, and delegations. Natural language replaces navigation.

**Timeline**: 6-8 weeks (phased approach, incremental delivery)

**Risk**: Previous attempt over-engineered with Dolphin/UITARS/DAG complexity and Claude Code lost context after 5-6 truncations.

**Mitigation**: Break into small, independent phases with clear handoff documents.

---

## Problem Analysis: Why v1 Can't Scale

### 1. The Unified Chat Problem ⚠️

**Current State (v1)**:
```
Inbox Tab → No chat
Triage Tab → No chat
Todo Tab → No chat
Delegations Tab → No chat
Operations Tab → Has OperationsChat.tsx (isolated, no context from other tabs)
Calendar Tab → No chat
Team Board → No chat
SMS Tab → Has chat but separate
```

**What You Want**:
- Single chat instance visible on ALL tabs
- Chat maintains context across tab switches
- Chat knows about emails from Inbox, tasks from Todo, etc.

**Why v1 Can't Do This**:
- **Component-based isolation** - Each tab is separate React component with own state
- **No global chat state** - Would need Redux/Zustand + context provider across entire app
- **Backend doesn't support multi-context** - Chat API is session-based but doesn't pull live data from other tabs
- **Memory system is one-way** - AI writes to agent_memory, but chat doesn't read it comprehensively

**Attempted Fix Would Require**:
1. Global state manager (Redux/Zustand) - adds 2K+ lines
2. Real-time sync between tabs - WebSocket/polling overhead
3. Context aggregation layer - complex query builder
4. Chat UI refactor across 8 tabs - high risk of regressions

**This is architectural debt, not a feature gap.**

---

### 2. Email Sanitization Problem

**v1 Flow**:
```
Gmail API → body_html (sanitized by Google)
         → Inline images become <img src="cid:...">
         → Need attachment lookup + replacement
         → Store in EmailAttachment table
         → Serve via /api/attachments/by-cid/...
```

**Problems**:
- HTML is sanitized (loses styles, layouts)
- Images require complex cid: replacement logic
- Attachments >255 chars broke until TEXT migration
- Email rendering is buggy (user reports issues)

**v2 Fix**:
```
SnappyMail → Direct IMAP to Gmail
          → Full HTML rendering (no sanitization)
          → Images load natively
          → Screenshot + Vision AI for OCR
```

No custom attachment handling. No sanitization workarounds. Simpler = better.

---

### 3. Context Fragmentation Problem

**v1 Memory Flow**:
```
AI Triage → agent_memory (triage events)
Daily Digest → agent_memory (digest events)
Operations Chat → agent_memory (chat events)
                ↓
                Each reads its own slice of memory
                No unified context builder
```

**Example Failure**:
```
User in Inbox tab: Sees email about "Sysco invoice"
User clicks to Todo tab: Adds task "Review invoice"
User goes to Operations tab, asks chat: "What's the status on that invoice?"
Chat response: "I don't see an invoice task" ❌
```

**Why?** Chat only loads context snapshot from session start. Doesn't know about:
- Tasks added in other tabs
- Emails analyzed in other tabs
- Live state changes

**v2 Fix**: Open-WebUI tools call live APIs. Every query pulls fresh state.

---

## Architecture Comparison: v1 vs v2

| Aspect | v1 (Current) | v2 (Vision) |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Interface** | 8 separate tabs (Inbox, Triage, Todo, etc.) | One chat interface (Open-WebUI) |
| **Navigation** | Click tabs → Click cards → Click buttons | Natural language ("Show me urgent emails") |
| **Chat** | Isolated to Operations tab | Global, context-aware across all operations |
| **Email** | Gmail API (sanitized) + attachment workarounds | SnappyMail (full IMAP, no sanitization) |
| **Context** | Fragmented (per tab, per session) | Unified (all data sources in one semantic space) |
| **Memory** | Agent memory table (one-way writes) | RAG + Qdrant (semantic search, two-way) |
| **AI Integration** | Hardcoded GPT-4o calls in backend | Open-WebUI tools framework (model-agnostic) |
| **Task Management** | Todo tab with Eisenhower matrix UI | "Add that to my todos" (conversational) |
| **Calendar** | Modal for adding events | "Add this to my calendar" (AUBS knows "this") |
| **Delegations** | Form-based 5-pillar entry | Guided conversation for delegation creation |
| **Image OCR** | Vision API for RAP Mobile only | Screenshot + Vision for ANY email image |
| **Frontend Code** | 15K+ lines (Next.js, React, TypeScript) | ~2K lines (Open-WebUI config + backend tools) |
| **Backend Code** | 78 API endpoints across 10 route files | ~30 tool endpoints (simpler, focused) |
| **Maintenance** | High (frontend + backend + sync logic) | Low (backend tools only) |

## Migration Strategy: How to Get from v1 to v2

### Core Principle: **Parallel Development, Incremental Cutover**

**Do NOT**:
- ❌ Rip out v1 and rebuild from scratch
- ❌ Try to "merge" v1 frontend into Open-WebUI
- ❌ Build everything before testing anything

**Do**:
- ✅ Keep v1 running (fallback if v2 has issues)
- ✅ Build v2 as separate stack (different ports)
- ✅ Migrate backend logic incrementally (share database)
- ✅ Test each phase before moving to next
- ✅ Cut over feature-by-feature, not all-at-once

## Detailed Implementation Plan

### Phase 0: Foundation (Week 1)

**Goal**: Prove the architecture works end-to-end.

**Tasks**:
1. **Deploy Open-WebUI** (Day 1)
   - Docker Compose or local install
   - Configure on port 8080 (v1 uses 3001, 8002)
   - Verify health check

2. **Deploy SnappyMail** (Day 1-2)
   - Docker on port 8888
   - Connect to Gmail via IMAP (user's work email)
   - Set up filters: `from:(@chilis.com OR @brinker.com OR @hotschedules.com)`
   - Verify full HTML email rendering

3. **Create AUBS Backend v2** (Day 2-3)
   - New FastAPI app: `/server_v2/app.py` (separate from v1)
   - Port 5000 (avoid conflict with 8002)
   - Database connection: reuse PostgreSQL from v1
   - Health endpoint: `GET /health`

4. **Implement First Tool** (Day 3-4)
   - Tool: `get_emails(limit, filter)`
   - Returns: List of emails from EmailCache table (reuse v1 DB)
   - Register tool with Open-WebUI (OpenAPI spec or MCP)

5. **Test End-to-End** (Day 5)
   - Open Open-WebUI chat
   - Ask: "Show me my recent emails"
   - Verify AUBS calls `get_emails` tool
   - Verify results appear in chat

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Open-WebUI running on port 8080
- ✅ SnappyMail showing work emails (not sanitized)
- ✅ AUBS backend v2 on port 5000

AUBS: [Calls get_emails(filter="unread")]
      "You have 12 unread emails. 3 are high priority:
       1. Manager schedule due today (from Stephanie)
       2. Blake called out - dinner shift (from Carmen)
       3. Sysco invoice approval needed (from Accounts)"

User: "Tell me more about the Blake callout"
AUBS: [Calls get_email_context(thread_id)]
      [Shows full email thread]
      "Blake called out sick. Dinner shift (4pm-close) needs coverage.
       Carmen is asking if Tiffany can cover."

AUBS: [Calls mark_email_done(thread_id)]
      "Marked as done. Removed from your urgent list."
```

#### 1.2 Task Tools (Week 2, Days 4-5)
```python
# /server_v2/tools/task_tools.py

def get_tasks(status="pending", priority=None):
    """Retrieve todo list"""
    # Query: tasks table (reuse v1)
    # Filter by: status, priority, eisenhower quadrant
    # Return: List[{title, due_date, priority, status}]

def add_task(title, priority="medium", due_date=None, notes=None):
    """Create new task"""
    # Insert: tasks table
    # Auto-calculate: eisenhower_quadrant from priority/due_date
    # Return: New task_id

def update_task(task_id, status=None, priority=None, due_date=None):
    """Update existing task"""
    # Update: tasks table
    # Return: Updated task

def delete_task(task_id):
    """Delete task"""
    # Delete: tasks table
    # Return: Success message
```

**Test Case**:
```
User: "What's on my todo list today?"
AUBS: [Calls get_tasks(due_date="today")]
      "You have 5 tasks due today:
       1. Submit manager schedule (HIGH)
       2. Review Sysco invoice (MEDIUM)
       3. Follow up with Devon on training (LOW)
       ..."

User: "Add finding Blake's coverage to high priority"
AUBS: [Calls add_task(title="Find dinner shift coverage for Blake",
                      priority="high",
                      due_date="today")]
      "Added to high-priority tasks. Due today."

User: "Mark the schedule as done"
AUBS: [Calls update_task(task_id=X, status="completed")]
      "Marked complete. 4 tasks remaining for today."
```

#### 1.3 Integration Testing (Week 3, Day 1)
```
User: "Show me urgent emails and add any action items to my todos"
AUBS: [Calls get_emails(filter="priority>80")]
      [For each email, calls triage_email(thread_id)]
      [Extracts suggested_tasks from analysis]
      [Calls add_task() for each suggested task]
      "Found 3 urgent emails. Added 5 tasks to your list:
       1. Call payroll about Hannah's hours (from Beth's email)
       2. Submit manager schedule by 3pm (from Stephanie)

      "Here's a draft delegation using the ChiliHead 5-pillar system:

       BELONGING: Tiffany, I'm trusting you with this because you're
                  great at rallying the team.

       DIRECTION: Find someone to cover Blake's 4pm-close shift tonight.
                  Confirm with me by 2pm.

       PREPARATION: Check the schedule, call the usual suspects
                   (Hannah, Devon). Use the coverage request template.

       SUPPORT: I'm available by phone if you hit issues. Text me updates.

       ACCOUNTABILITY: Follow up with me at 2pm. If no luck by 1pm,

       2. Nov 8: Follow-up email - Payroll confirmed correction

       3. Nov 12: Agent memory - Added follow-up task (completed)

       Want me to pull up any of these threads?"
```

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Agent memory migrated to Qdrant
- ✅ Semantic search works for past operations
- ✅ Email history searchable by natural language
- ✅ Memory persists across sessions

**Deliverable**: RAG system + memory migration

**Handoff Document**: `PHASE_4_COMPLETE.md`

---

### Phase 5: Polish + Cutover (Weeks 7-8)

**Goal**: Production-ready v2, deprecate v1.

#### 5.1 Error Handling (Week 7, Days 1-2)
- Tool timeouts (5s max)
- Gmail API rate limit handling
- Graceful degradation (if calendar API fails, continue with emails)
- User-friendly error messages

#### 5.2 Performance Tuning (Week 7, Days 3-4)
- Cache tool results (Redis)
- Optimize database queries (add indexes)
- Batch operations where possible

#### 5.3 Testing (Week 7, Day 5 - Week 8, Day 2)
- End-to-end test cases (20+ scenarios)
- Load testing (simulate 100 emails/day)
- Edge cases (empty results, malformed data)

#### 5.4 Migration (Week 8, Days 3-5)
- Run v1 and v2 in parallel for 3 days
- Use v2 for daily operations
- Document issues, fix bugs
- Deprecate v1 frontend (keep backend for data access)

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ All v1 features work in v2
- ✅ No data loss during migration
- ✅ v2 is faster and easier to use than v1
- ✅ User prefers v2 for daily work

## Risk Mitigation: How to Avoid "Claude Code Forgets"

### The Problem
Previous attempt:
- Built too much at once (Dolphin + UITARS + DAG orchestration)
- Long implementation sessions (5-6 truncations)
- Claude Code lost context of what was built and why
- Ended up with code that didn't integrate

### The Solution: **Micro-Phases + Handoff Documents**

#### Rule 1: One Tool at a Time
**Do**:
- "Implement `get_emails` tool. Test it. Stop."
- "Implement `add_task` tool. Test it. Stop."

**Don't**:
- "Implement all email tools" (too broad)
- "Build the email system" (way too broad)

#### Rule 2: Handoff Documents
After each tool/phase, create a handoff doc:

**Template**:
```markdown
# HANDOFF: get_emails Tool

## What Was Built
- File: /server_v2/tools/email_tools.py
- Function: get_emails(limit, filter)
- Database: Queries EmailCache table from v1
- Returns: List of email dicts

## How to Test
curl http://localhost:5000/tools/get_emails?limit=5

## Expected Output
[{"thread_id": "...", "subject": "...", "sender": "...", ...}]

## What's Next
- Build: triage_email tool
- Depends on: This tool (get_emails)
- No blockers
```

**Why This Works**:
- Claude Code can read the handoff doc and pick up exactly where it left off
- No need to re-explain the entire architecture
- Clear test case proves it works
- Next step is explicit

#### Rule 3: Test Before Moving On
**Checkpoint after each tool**:
1. Write the tool
2. Test it manually (curl or chat)
3. Verify output is correct
4. Write handoff doc
5. STOP. Wait for user confirmation before next tool.

#### Rule 4: Share Database, Not Code
v1 and v2 can share PostgreSQL:
- v2 tools query same tables (EmailCache, tasks, delegations)
- No need to migrate data mid-build
- v1 continues working while v2 is built

#### Rule 5: No Over-Engineering
**Avoid**:
- Custom orchestration frameworks (Dolphin/DAG)
- Visual debugging tools (UITARS)
- Complex abstractions before you need them

**Use**:
- Open-WebUI's built-in tool system
- Simple Python functions
- Standard libraries (httpx, SQLAlchemy)

---

## Implementation Workflow (For Working with Claude Code)

### Session Template

**Session Start**:
1. "We're building v2 Phase X. Read PHASE_X_PLAN.md."
2. "Start with the first tool: [tool name]."
3. "Here's the spec: [paste spec from this doc]."

**During Session**:
1. Claude Code implements tool
2. You test it: `curl ...` or chat test
3. If it works: "Write handoff doc and stop."
4. If it doesn't: "Fix [specific issue] and re-test."

**Session End**:
1. Claude Code writes handoff doc
2. You review handoff doc
3. You commit: `git add . && git commit -m "Phase X: Implemented [tool name]"`
4. Next session starts with: "Read HANDOFF_[tool name].md and continue with next tool."

### Breaking Big Tasks
If a phase feels too big (>5 tools), break it further:

**Phase 1a**: Email read tools (get_emails, get_email_context)
**Phase 1b**: Email write tools (mark_email_done, triage_email)
**Phase 1c**: Task CRUD tools

Each sub-phase = one session = one handoff doc.

---

## Success Criteria

### Must-Haves (v1 Parity)
- ✅ All emails triaged with AI analysis
- ✅ Tasks tracked with Eisenhower Matrix
- ✅ ChiliHead 5-pillar delegations work
- ✅ Conversation history persists
- ✅ Daily briefing generation
- ✅ Deadline extraction and tracking

### Better Than v1
- ✅ No email sanitization (SnappyMail)
- ✅ Image preview + OCR works
- ✅ **Unified chat across all operations** (solves the core problem)
- ✅ Context maintained ("that invoice", "the urgent one")
- ✅ Google Calendar integrated
- ✅ Natural language > clicking tabs

### Measurable Goals
- **Context Success**: "Show me that email" works 95%+ of the time (AUBS knows "that")
- **Tool Success Rate**: 95%+ of tool calls succeed
- **User Preference**: User chooses v2 over v1 for daily work after 1 week
- **Maintenance**: <2 hours/week for bug fixes (vs 5+ hours/week in v1)

---

## What You Get at the End

**v1 (Before)**:
```
User: Switches to Inbox tab
User: Clicks email to read
User: Switches to Triage tab
User: Clicks "Analyze" button
User: Reads AI analysis
User: Switches to Todo tab
User: Clicks "Add Task" button
User: Fills out form
User: Clicks Save
User: Switches to Operations tab
User: Types in chat: "What's urgent today?"
Chat: "I don't have access to your email or tasks" ❌
```

**v2 (After)**:
```
User: "AUBS, what needs my attention today?"
AUBS: [One unified context, sees everything]
      "You have 3 urgent items:
       1. Manager schedule due by 3pm
       2. Blake's shift needs coverage
       3. Sysco invoice ($2,847) needs review

       Want me to add these to your calendar or pull up details?"

User: "Show me the invoice"
AUBS: [Remembers "invoice" = Sysco invoice from context]
      [Screenshots from SnappyMail, OCRs with Vision AI]
      "Invoice #SYS-247832, $2,847.32, due Dec 22..."

User: "Add reviewing it to my high priority todos"
AUBS: [Knows "it" = that invoice]
      [Calls add_task with context]
      "Added to high priority. Due Dec 22."
```

**One conversation. Full context. Natural language. No tab switching.**

That's the vision, and this plan gets you there without losing the plot.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Review this plan** - Does it make sense? Any gaps?
2. **Approve Phase 0** - Ready to start with Open-WebUI setup?
3. **Set up tracking** - Use Linear/Notion/GitHub Projects for task tracking
4. **Begin Phase 0** - First session: "Set up Open-WebUI and test first tool"

## Appendix: Tech Stack Comparison

| Component | v1 | v2 |
|-----------|----|----|
| Frontend | Next.js (15K lines) | Open-WebUI (config only) |
| Backend | FastAPI (78 endpoints) | FastAPI (30 tools) |
| Database | PostgreSQL | PostgreSQL (shared) |
| Email | Gmail API (sanitized) | SnappyMail (IMAP) |
| AI | OpenAI hardcoded | Multi-model via Open-WebUI |
| Memory | agent_memory table | Qdrant + RAG |
| Chat | Component-based | Unified (Open-WebUI) |
| Calendar | Google Calendar API | Google Calendar API (reuse) |
| Vision | RAP Mobile only | All images (Vision AI) |
| Deploy | Manual start scripts | Docker Compose |

**Lines of Code Estimate**:
- v1: ~20K lines (15K frontend + 5K backend)
- v2: ~3K lines (0 frontend + 3K backend tools)

**Maintenance Burden**:
- v1: High (frontend + backend + sync + state)
- v2: Low (backend tools only, Open-WebUI handles UI)

***#CORRECTIONS#***
ok I have questions you said Implement First Tool (Day 3-4)

Tool: get_emails(limit, filter) WHY-- ? Returns: List of emails from EmailCache table (reuse v1 DB) --? Why reuse v1 when we could pull from snappy? Snappy is open source cant we access that ?

ok I have questions you said Implement First Tool (Day 3-4)

Tool: get_emails(limit, filter) WHY-- ? Returns: List of emails from EmailCache table (reuse v1 DB) --? Why reuse v1 when we could pull from snappy? Snappy is open source cant we access that ?

You're absolutely right to question this. This is a key architectural decision, and my original plan took the "safe" route when there's a better option.

The Options:
Option 1: Reuse v1 EmailCache (what I suggested)
get_emails() → Query PostgreSQL EmailCache table

Why I said this:

Quick win - data already there
Don't need to figure out SnappyMail integration first
Why it's NOT ideal:

❌ Still maintaining v1's sync job
❌ Two sources of truth (Gmail cache + SnappyMail)
❌ Not actually simplifying anything
❌ Defeats the purpose of moving to SnappyMail
Option 2: Query SnappyMail's Database (your suggestion)
get_emails() → Query SnappyMail's MySQL/SQLite database directly

Pros:

✅ Single source of truth
✅ No sync job needed
✅ SnappyMail already has the emails
Cons:

⚠️ Coupled to SnappyMail's schema (if they change it, we break)
⚠️ Need to figure out their schema (rainloop_* tables)
⚠️ SnappyMail's DB is optimized for viewing, not querying
Option 3: Direct IMAP (cleanest for v2) ⭐ BEST CHOICE
get_emails() → Python imaplib/aioimap → Gmail IMAP directly

Why this is better:

✅ No EmailCache table needed (simplifies v2)
✅ Real-time data (always fresh from Gmail)
✅ SnappyMail is independent (just for viewing/screenshots)
✅ Standard protocol (IMAP is well-documented, stable)
✅ Less code (no sync job, no cache maintenance)
What about performance?

For 50-100 emails/day, direct IMAP is fast enough
If needed, cache in Redis (ephemeral, fast) not PostgreSQL
IMAP search is efficient (SEARCH UNSEEN, SEARCH SINCE date)
Updated Architecture for v2
Email Data Flow (NEW):
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  AUBS Tool: get_emails()                │
│  - Connects to Gmail via IMAP           │
│  - Fetches subject, sender, date, body  │
│  - Returns to Open-WebUI                │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
         ↓
    Gmail IMAP (imap.gmail.com)
    (Same source SnappyMail uses)

Email Viewing Flow:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  AUBS Tool: screenshot_email(thread_id) │
│  - Opens SnappyMail in browser          │
│  - Takes screenshot                     │
│  - Returns image for Vision AI          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
         ↓
    SnappyMail (port 8888)
         ↓
    Gmail IMAP (same source)

Key insight: SnappyMail and AUBS both read from Gmail IMAP independently. No coupling.

Code Example (Direct IMAP)
# /server_v2/tools/email_tools.py
import imaplib
import email
from email.header import decode_header

def get_emails(limit=20, filter="UNSEEN"):
    """Fetch emails directly from Gmail IMAP"""
    
    # Connect to Gmail
    imap = imaplib.IMAP4_SSL("imap.gmail.com")
    imap.login(user_email, app_password)  # OAuth2 or app password
    imap.select("INBOX")
    
    # Search emails
    status, messages = imap.search(None, filter)  # "UNSEEN", "ALL", "SINCE 01-Jan-2024"
    email_ids = messages[0].split()[-limit:]  # Last N emails
    
    results = []
    for email_id in email_ids:
        status, msg_data = imap.fetch(email_id, "(RFC822)")
        msg = email.message_from_bytes(msg_data[0][1])
        
        results.append({
            "id": email_id.decode(),
            "subject": decode_header(msg["Subject"])[0][0],
            "sender": msg["From"],
            "date": msg["Date"],
            "snippet": msg.get_payload()[:200]  # First 200 chars
        })
    
    imap.logout()
    return results

That's it. No database. No sync job. Just IMAP.

What About v1's EmailCache?
Short answer: Don't need it in v2.
Long answer: Depends on what you want to keep from v1.
v1 uses EmailCache for:

Email analysis cache (priority scores, AI triage results)
Offline access (emails stored locally)
Attachment storage (inline images for cid: replacement)
In v2:

Analysis cache → Move to EmailAnalysisCache table (keep this, it's valuable)
Offline access → Not needed (IMAP is fast enough, always online)
Attachments → SnappyMail handles this (screenshot for Vision AI)
So we'd keep EmailAnalysisCache (AI results) but drop EmailCache (email mirror).

Updated Phase 0 Plan
Original (what I wrote):
Day 3-4: Implement get_emails() tool
  - Query EmailCache table from v1
  - Reuse existing data

Updated (better approach):
Day 3-4: Implement get_emails() tool
  - Connect to Gmail via IMAP (imaplib or aioimap)
  - Fetch emails with filters (UNSEEN, SINCE date, FROM sender)
  - Return list of emails with metadata
  - Test: "Show me my unread emails"

Why this is better for avoiding "Claude Code forgets":

Simpler code (fewer moving parts)
No dependency on v1 (clean slate)
Standard library (imaplib is built into Python)
Clear scope (one file, one function, one test)
Your Question Answered
"Why reuse v1 when we could pull from SnappyMail?"

You're right. We shouldn't reuse v1's EmailCache. Better options:

Best: Direct IMAP (what SnappyMail uses anyway)
Alternative: SnappyMail's database (if you want to leverage their storage)
Avoid: v1's EmailCache (adds complexity, defeats the purpose)
My recommendation: Go with Direct IMAP. It's simpler, cleaner, and aligns with the v2 vision of "80% less code."

**Built with lessons learned from v1. Keep it simple. Leverage ecosystems. Ship incrementally.**
